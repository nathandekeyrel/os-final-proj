<h1>Analysis of The Completely Fair Scheduler</h1>

<h2>CSCI - 460 Final Project</h2>
<p>We researched and implemented the CFS algorithm, simulating and tracking performance in the user-space.</p>
<p>In class, we covered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Come First Serve</li>
  <li>Round Robin</li>
  <li>Shortest Process Next</li>
  <li>Shortest Remaining Time</li>
  <li>Highest Response Ratio Next</li>
  <li>Feedback</li>  
</ul>
<p>For our project, we wanted to see what's used in modern operating systems.</p>
<p>This led us researching and a partial implementation of CFS:</p>

<p>we generated theoretical workloads using python -- easier to deal with files.</p>
<p>The remainder of the project was written in C to stay true to the original algorithms and its use case.</p>
