<h1>Analysis of The Completely Fair Scheduler</h1>

<h2>CSCI - 460 Final Project</h2>
<p>We researched and implemented the CFS algorithm, simulating and tracking performance in the user-space.</p>
<p>In class, we covered</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Come First Serve</li>
  <li>Round Robin</li>
  <li>Shortest Process Next</li>
  <li>Shortest Remaining Time</li>
  <li>Highest Response Ratio Next</li>
  <li>Feedback</li>  
</ul>
<p>For our project, we wanted to see what's used in modern operating systems</p>
<p>This led us researching and implementing CFS:</p>

<p>There were two aspects of the project developed in python: Workload generation and metric visualization.</p>
<p>Working with files and graphs are just easier in python.</p>
